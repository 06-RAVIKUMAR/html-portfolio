<h1>The Best Movies According to Ravi Kumar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr >
<h3>Bahubali</h3>
<p>This is my favourite motion picture from India. I loved the graphics and action sequences.</p>
<h3>Jailer</h3>
<p>Purely one man show movie. Fans Demigod Rajini literally blasted the Box Office and Anirudh's Music gets you goosebumps.</p>
<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>It's again Rajamouli master piece. Story, Graphics, Acion Sequences everything brings the movie to next level.</p>
